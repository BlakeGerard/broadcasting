6. Name the highlight using the following format:

```
Event: Speakername - Title [year]
```

7. Provide a Description, and also provide tags. 

For the Description, try going to Meetup.com and seeing if there is one there provided by the group. It's just a copy + paste and you know it's correct. This is the preferred way to go.

For the tags there are a few things you'll always include:
 * The speaker's name
 * A very clear keyword or set of keywords for the content. ( `Carson McKinstry, Techlahoma, Bootstrap, Portfolio Site, Free Code Camp OKC` )
 * "Techlahoma"
 * Anything else highly relevant.

8. The category may vary, but **Programming** is a safe bet.

9. Click **Save Changes**.

The highlight is now ready for export and upload to YouTube.
